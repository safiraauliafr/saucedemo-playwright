# SauceDemo Automation Project

## Project Overview

This project automates the SauceDemo web application using Playwright with TypeScript.
It is designed with a modular structure, leveraging the Page Object Model (POM) and data-driven testing to improve maintainability, scalability, and code quality.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Test Infrastructure
