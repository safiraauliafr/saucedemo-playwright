# SauceDemo Automation Project  

![CI](https://github.com/ysafiraauliafr/saucedemo-playwright/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project automates the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) web application using **Playwright with TypeScript**.  
It follows modern QA automation best practices, including:  

- **Page Object Model (POM)** for maintainability  
- **Data-driven testing** (Excel/CSV as external test data)  
- **Parallel + cross-browser execution** (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)  
- **Automatic screenshots on failure**  
- **HTML test reports** for clear results  

The framework is designed to be **scalable, modular, and CI-ready**, making it suitable for enterprise-level testing.
